        There is a beautiful hiking trail on the Northwest side of the lake that
        follows a river. It has a prairie area with shade trees and a more
        wooded area with steep hills. It is not uncommon to see deer, turtles,
        snakes, and beautiful birds. The trail is paved and at the tallest
        points there is a gorgeous view
