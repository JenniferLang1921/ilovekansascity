      <h1>A Romantic Italian Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Begin the date with her favorite flowers, if you do not know what they
        are, find a sneaky way to ask 'because you are curious' and then
        surprise your date with them. I recommend buying flowers cheap, I like
        grocery store flowers.

        Dinner Romance Tips:
        <ul>
          <li>Sit beside her, not across from her</li>
          <li>
            Order wine, one appetizer, one main course, one dessert, more
            wine.... share everything and feed each other.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner, go for a gondola ride from
        https://www.ambianceonthewater.com/ at the Kansas City Plaza that you
        have already reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leave some time after your gondola ride to walk around the plaza window
        shopping and holding hands.
